# Chronic_kidney_disease_classifier
Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease using ML algorithms.
Dataset used: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease
The CKD dataset is based on clinical history, physical examinations, and laboratory tests.

Data pre-processing covers removing outliars, replacing missing values, data reduction and normalization. 

Moreover, four machine learning alghoritms have been applied to the dataset. These algorithms are logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB).
